        <b>I do not have a booking, can I still fly from Amsterdam to Boston?</b>
        <br>
        You will still be able to participate in the event, even without a slot. The scheduled slots allow for additional flights, be aware of possible delays though if you do not have a slot. On the day of the event a route for non-booked flights will be made available, including a NAT track. Be sure to use this route if you do not have a booking to expedite your departure.

        <b>What timezone are the times quoted on my booking?</b>
        <br>
        All times are in UTC (zulu).

    <p>
        <b>Do I need to book if I wish to take part in the event?</b>
        <br>
        In short, yes. If you do not book you can experience delays. We try to accommodate as many people without a booking though.

        <b>What does CTOT stand for?</b>
        <br>
        CTOT stands for "Calculated Takeoff Time". This is the time when you should be cleared for take-off. This is not the time you go off-blocks!

        <b>When will I receive my route for the event?</b>
        <br>
        The routes will be sent out no later than 06:00 UTC on the day of the event. Please be patient when waiting for your route.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I still haven't received the email confirming my route, what shall I do?</b>
        <br>
        Firstly check your spam box and ensure that the email from us hasn't made its way into there. Secondly, contact us. Do this ASAP and someone will get back to you and provide you with the required details.
